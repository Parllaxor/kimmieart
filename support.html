            <h3>How can I get something custom made?</h3>
            <p>Just feel free to contact me! You can visit the <a href = "shopping.html">shopping page</a> directly, or send me a text/email with a request!</p>
            <h3>How much do you charge for custom requests?</h3>
            <p>It depends on the difficulty of the art piece and how long it will take me, so when you have a request, I will charge a very reasonable price for what you've asked for!</p>
            <h3>What kinds of products do you offer?</h3>
            <p>I create normal paintings, drawings, and other types of art. Without further request you will receive the art piece, however for a small extra charge I can offer mugs, shirts, and many other options!</p>

        <div id = "contactsection2">
            <h2>Want something custom made?</h2>
            <p>I would love to help make something that would be peronsalized to you! I would love to paint or draw anything you'd like, in my own personal style!</p>
            <h3>I can design something for a specific event if you would like! Some examples include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class = "fancytext">Birthdays</li>
                <li class = "fancytext">Weddings</li>
                <li class = "fancytext">Anniversaries</li>
                <li>And so much more!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Just give me enough time to get it finished and make it beautiful for your event!</p>

            <h3>Price</h3>
            <p>Depending on the time and difficulty of the project, price can vary. Typical projects will cost anywhere from $20-50, but some more difficult requests may cost upwards of $100. Just send me the request, and I will inform you of the cost before I start working on it, and won't stop until you're satisfied with what you got!</p>

            <h3>Special requests</h3>
            <p>Special requests such as shoe painting, woodburning projects, chess sets and others will take much longer, and will likely charge more than typical projects, but I am still happy to make them!</p>
